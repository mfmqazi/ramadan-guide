                    <p>
                        Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and holds immense significance
                        in the life of every Muslim. It is a month of fasting, prayer, reflection, and community.
                        The month commemorates the first revelation of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
                        him).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This sacred month is an opportunity for spiritual renewal, self-discipline, and drawing
                        closer to Allah. Through fasting from dawn to sunset, Muslims develop empathy for those
                        less fortunate and strengthen their connection with their Creator.

                        Ramadan and the Qur'an share a special bond. Allah revealed the Qur'an during this blessed
                        month, specifically on Laylatul Qadr. The Angel Jibreel would review the Qur'an with Prophet
                        Muhammad (peace be upon him) every Ramadan, and in his final year, they reviewed it twice.

                        said: "Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous
                        sins will be forgiven." These prayers typically involve recitation of the entire Qur'an over
                        the course of the month.

                        a thousand months. It is a night of peace, blessings, and divine mercy.

                        "Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the
                        Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the

                    <h3>When is Laylatul Qadr?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The exact date of Laylatul Qadr is not specified, but it falls within the last ten nights
                        of Ramadan, particularly on the odd nights (21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, or 29th). The Prophet
                        (peace be upon him) encouraged seeking it during these nights, with the 27th night being
                        commonly emphasized.

                    <p>
                        I'tikaf is a spiritual retreat in the mosque, where a person secludes themselves for worship,
                        particularly during the last ten days of Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
                        regularly performed I'tikaf during these days to seek Laylatul Qadr and dedicate himself
                        entirely to worship.

                    <p>
                        Zakat is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, an obligatory charity that purifies wealth and
                        helps those in need. While Zakat is due annually when wealth reaches a certain threshold
                        (nisab), many Muslims choose to pay it during Ramadan to maximize blessings.

                <div class="content-block fade-in-up">

                    <ul>
                        <li>Muslims who possess wealth above the nisab threshold</li>
                        <li>The wealth must be owned for one lunar year</li>
                        <li>The person must be of sound mind and adult</li>
                        <li>Zakat is typically 2.5% of accumulated wealth</li>

                    <p>The Qur'an specifies eight categories of people eligible to receive Zakat:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The poor (al-fuqara)</li>
                        <li>The needy (al-masakin)</li>
                        <li>Zakat administrators</li>
                        <li>Those whose hearts are to be reconciled</li>
                        <li>Those in bondage (slaves and captives)</li>

                    <p>
                        Beyond obligatory Zakat, Ramadan is an excellent time for Sadaqah (voluntary charity).
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was even more
                        generous during Ramadan.

                        <li>Provide iftar meals for fasting people</li>

                        Zakat al-Fitr is a special charity given before Eid prayer. It purifies the fast and
                        provides food for the needy so they can celebrate Eid. Every Muslim, regardless of age
                        or wealth, should give this charity (or have it given on their behalf).

                        It's a gift from Allah to the believers who successfully completed the month of fasting.
                        The word "Eid" means festivity, and "Fitr" means breaking the fast.
